    "bio": "I'm Reynir, married with two young daughters. I enjoy walking our dog, lifting weights and playing music. I suffered an injury a few years back and had to reevaluate my career, so I went back to school and am currently two thirds of the way through my BSc degree in software engineering. My current academic interests are in web programming, and I will be taking courses on web services and another on networks in the fall. Another area of academic interest is computer games and I will be taking courses on computer graphics and game making in the fall as well.",
